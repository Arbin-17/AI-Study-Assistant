# # -> **IMPORTING LIBRARIES :-**
# 
# **import numpy as np** :- Imports the NumPy library, which is used for numerical computations and linear algebra operations.
# 
# **import pandas as pd** :- Imports the Pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling structured data like CSV files.
# 
# <br>
# 
# ---
# # -> LISTING INPUT FILES :-
# 
# **import os** :- Imports the os module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system, such as navigating directories and handling files.
# 
# The **os.walk('/kaggle/input')** function is used to traverse the directory /kaggle/input, which is a read-only directory in Kaggle notebooks containing input data files.
# 
# The nested for loops iterate through all the files in this directory and print their full paths using **os.path.join(dirname, filename).**
